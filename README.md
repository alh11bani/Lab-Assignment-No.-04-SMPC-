# Lab-Assignment-No.-04-SMPC-
# Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) Lab

## 🧩 Description
This project demonstrates **Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC)** using Python and Google Colab.  
It includes three main parts:

1. **MPC Sum using Secret Sharing**  
   - Three parties hold private numbers and compute the total sum without revealing individual values.  

2. **Shamir’s Secret Sharing Implementation**  
   - Demonstrates a (k, n) threshold scheme using polynomial-based secret sharing.  
   - Any k shares can reconstruct the secret; fewer than k shares reveal nothing.  

3. **Garbled Circuits Example (AND Gate)**  
   - Implements a simple garbled circuit representing an AND gate.  
   - Participants compute the output using encrypted labels without revealing their inputs.
